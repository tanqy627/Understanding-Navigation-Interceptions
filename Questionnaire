\section{Questions in the online survey}
\label{appendix:questions}
Note: Our questionnaire was published in Chinese. The following is the English translation.

\vspace{ 3pt}\noindent \textbf{Description.} 
Hello, thank you for your participation in this survey. The objective of this survey is to comprehensively understand how interceptions occurring during the browsing process affect usersâ€™ browsing experience and willingness. 
The result of this survey will aid in enhancing user browsing security and browsing experience.

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Navigation interceptions:} 
Typically, when browsing the Internet, web browsers or mobile apps directly display the desired website (i.e., target page). However, in some cases, additional operations might be required before the target page is displayed or the desired website may be blocked from being displayed. This situation is referred to as ``navigation interception'', where the target page cannot be directly displayed.

\end{itemize}

This survey is brief and should only take around ten minutes to complete. Please respond truthfully within the survey based on your genuine browsing experiences with web browsers or mobile apps. The survey is completely anonymous and does not seek to extract any sensitive information. The collected results are intended solely for academic research purposes and will be kept highly confidential. Rest assured, your personal privacy is of utmost importance and will not be violated. Please feel free to participate in this study. In case of any queries, please do not hesitate to contact the researchers responsible for this study.

\vspace{ 3pt}\noindent \textbf{Part 1: Introduction to Navigation Interception}

\vspace{ 3pt}\noindent \textit{Please read the following text and answer questions Q1-Q3:}

During browsing, the \textbf{browsing client (which includes web browsers and mobile apps)} generally displays the webpage that the user intends to visit. However, in some cases, the process of displaying the target webpage may be intercepted. As a result, users may need to take additional operations to continue browsing or may even be unable to continue browsing (browsing is prohibited, as shown in Figure~\ref{Figure:InterceptionExample}). Target webpages can be intercepted by browsing clients, servers, or firewalls amongst others. This study \textbf{only} focuses on interception caused by the browsing client. The specific behavior of the browsing client that results in website interception is referred to as ``navigation interception''.

\vspace{ 3pt}\noindent Q1. Have you understood the meaning of navigation interception?

\noindent(a) Yes  (b) No


\vspace{ 3pt}\noindent Q2. According to the definition, please determine whether the following description belongs to ``navigation interception'' or not: \textit{When using WeChat (a \textbf{mobile app}) to click on a shopping link sent by a friend, WeChat displays an external-link prompt and asks users to click to continue browsing.}

\noindent(a) Yes  (b) No

\vspace{ 3pt}\noindent Q3. Have you ever encountered navigation interception caused by your browsers or mobile apps during your daily web browsing?

\vspace{ 3pt}\noindent \textbf{Part 2: Users' experience on reasons of Navigation Interception.}

\vspace{ 3pt}\noindent \textit{Please read the following content and answer questions Q4-Q5:}

Upon navigation interception, browsing clients typically provide corresponding reasons through page prompts. The browsing client typically provides reasons categorized as follows: (1) \textbf{Security}, where the target website is potentially harmful to the user's browsing security; (2) \textbf{External link}, where the target website does not belong to the current browsing client, such as a Taobao page being an external link to WeChat; (3) \textbf{Violating local regulations}, where the target website violates the laws and regulations of the user's region; and (4) \textbf{Violating community guidelines}, where the target website violates the guidelines of the browsing client.
